              <p> Entering their third season in the PRO Chess League, the Pittsburgh Pawngrabbers hope to continue last yearâ€™s success, despite being labeled as underdogs. In our inaugural year, we struggled to compete in a league filled with powerhouse teams such as the Saint Louis Archbishops. In fact, we had to compete in a preliminary match to ensure we had a spot in the league. This past year, however, was a different story. We placed 2nd in our division and therefore ensured ourselves a spot in the playoffs, but, unfortunately, were eliminated in the first round by the St Louis Archbishops.</p>

              <p> This year, like previous years, we are an organization that is committed to hard work and excellence. Our goal for this season is to replicate the success we found last season. We will be a force to be reckoned with in every match and, ultimately strive to not only reach the playoffs, but to also advance further within the playoffs. While we are a chess organization we also seek to recognize our Pittsburgh roots. Our mission, as an organization, is not only to have a lasting impact on the Pittsburgh chess community, but to have an impact on the Pittsburgh community as a whole.</p>
